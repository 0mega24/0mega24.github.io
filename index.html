<p>My name is Sean Lidy, I went to Edwardsburg Highschool in Edwardsburg Michigan. I enjoy working on image manipulation and processing projects. Currently I am working on a couple nerf blaster modifications and a image parsing program. I did FTC for 4 years and am still keeping in touch with the robotics teams from back home helping where I can.</p>
